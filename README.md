Hello!

This is a exploratory analysis I did to research the stock prices of several banks during the 2008 recession.
I was mainly curious about which banks expereinced the worst crash in prices, were there any historical events
that correlated with the price fluctuations, and also just wanting to practice my plot visualization skills using
Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Thanks!
